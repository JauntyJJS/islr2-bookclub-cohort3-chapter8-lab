# ISLR2 Chapter 8 lab notes for R4DS book club cohort 3

An Introduction to Statistical Learning: With Applications in R Second Edition Chapter 8 lab notes for R for Data Science book club cohort 3.  

Here are the source code for my [lab notes](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/islr2-bookclub-cohort3-chapter8-lab)

## Render into html document

There is an R script, [utils/render.R](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/BioPAN_Tutorial/tree/main/utils/render.R), that contains the lines to render everything in its correct location. So, when you have the "index.Rmd" file opened (and your working directory is at its root), simply run **`source("utils/render.R")`** in the console (or the relevant lines in that file). This will run the rendering file and create all the files.
